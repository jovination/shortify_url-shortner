<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Shortify is a versatile project that combines the functions of a URL shortener and a QR code generator. I designed Shortify to provide an all-in-one solution that simplifies links and scans, catering to numerous areas of productivity and usefulness.</p>
<h1>key Objective</h1>
<h2>1. Make Links Shorter:</h2>
<p>Ever see a web link that's super long and messy? Shortify fixes that! It turns those long links into short, sweet ones that are easy to remember and share.</p>
<h2>2. Create QR Codes:</h2>
<p>Shortify doesn't stop at shortening links. It can also make those square codes you often see. Scan these with your phone, and it takes you right to a website. It's like magic, but in a QR code!</p>
